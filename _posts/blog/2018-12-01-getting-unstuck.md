Something that I deal with pretty often while coding is getting stuck. I don't think this is 
necessarily a bad thing! A lot of coding is just putting together a lot of small puzzles together.
And puzzles wouldn't be much fun without a challenge :)

I wanted to write down some general steps that I like to take when I get stuck. These steps might
have to be altered slightly depending on each situation, but I think this general process has been
helpful.

### 1. Break down the problem
This is really helpful for me when I'm working on problems that I really do not know how to 
approach. I like to keep asking myself the following questions until I get a list of "bite-sized" tasks. It also allows me to be honest about what I know and don't know.
* *What am I trying to do?*
* *Are there already functions that do what I need? If not, what functions will I need to create to get what I want?*
* *What data do I need to keep track of? How do I store and pass it?*
* *What limitations do I have?*

These questions also are helpful when I'm getting help from others/searching for help online. 
It's always good to be as clear as possible about what information you want from others.

### 2. Figure out how to debug (and debug often)!
I always try to be skeptical of code that I write. I try to verify code that I'm writing often, 
so I don't end up running into problems that are scattered all over the place. I also try to 
avoid copy-pasting solutions that I don't understand -- it's generally faster for me to debug code 
that I've written because I'll understand my thought process as I was putting it together.

### 3. Document (everything)!
This is especially true when working with technology you have very little/no familiarity with.
You don't have to keep a pristine log of everything you've done - this document is for you!
It's nice to have some paper trail of successes and failures, so if you ever need to reimplement
something similar, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. It also helps you be really honest about
what you understand/don't understand.

### 4. Give yourself time / be patient with yourself
Getting unstuck can take a lot of time - so try to mentally prepare yourself for it. Give yourself
time to fail! It can take several attempts before you get to a working solution - and if you're stuck,
you won't know which way is correct until you try. Also, remember that *you are still gaining useful 
knowledge when you fail*. So be patient with yourself! Persist! And have fun!
