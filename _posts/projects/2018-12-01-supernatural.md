Supernatural is a 2D platformer game made in Unity, based off the hit-television series 
*Supernatural*. You play as Dean and your goal is to fight off any demons that you encounter to
find Sam. 

This was based off a class project that I originally built this with two friends (Megan R., 
Sakke O.) using Slick2D, which is a lightweight graphics framework for building games in Java. We 
had a lot of fun while making it, so we decided to work on it for a bit after we had turned it in. 
I decided to move it to Unity, which provides better support for making games.
