A 2.5D time-travel pirate game made using C# and Unity. The user plays as a pirate, who solves 
mini-levels using their ability to travel back in time. I refactored the game architecture to 
make time travel mechanism more robust. Additionally, I enhanced the user interface by displaying 
player information, such as health, charge, and timer.
