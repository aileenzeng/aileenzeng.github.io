Picaroon is a 2.5D platformer game made in Unity. The user plays as a swashbuckling time-traveling
pirate. The game is made up of several mini-levels that require the pirate to time travel to beat
and giant spiders to fight against. All of the artwork was made from scratch with Blender.

Picaroon was built for my *Projects in CS* class that I took in my senior year of high school. I 
was in a team with 4 other people (Hazel P., Cameron C., Lena R., Sage M.). I refactored the game 
architecture to make time travel mechanism more robust. Additionally, I enhanced the user interface 
by displaying player information, such as health, charge, and timer.
