This is an ongoing project at the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu).

Project Sidewalk is working to understand street-level accessibility in cities at scale. We have an
[online tool](https://sidewalk.cs.washington.edu) that allows anyone to virtually audit streets in 
Washington D.C. and label different accessibility features and problems.

I primarily contribute to the online tool. I have helped improve UI features, and am currently
designing a validation interface that allows users to verify previously placed labels.
