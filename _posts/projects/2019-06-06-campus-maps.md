Campus Maps is a web application that displays the quickest path from two buildings on UW campus 
using Dijkstra's algorithm. I used ReactJS to build the front-end and a Java Spark server for the
back-end. This was a project that I made in CSE331, which is our Software Design & Implementation 
course.
