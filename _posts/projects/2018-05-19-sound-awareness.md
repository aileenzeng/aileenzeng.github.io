This project is focused on learning about how people who are deaf or hard of hearing experience 
sounds in the home and creating smarthome-based sound awareness systems for people who are DHH. 
This is an ongoing project at the Makeability Lab.

I was briefly involved in this project in August 2018, where I helped **run a Wizard of Oz user 
study** to evaluate the experiences and perceptions of DHH participants with some preliminary 
mockups of an in-home sound awareness system. 

I also was a **co-author for our group's CHI2019 publication**:
* Jain, D., Lin, A., Amalachandran, M., **Zeng, A.**, Findlater, L., Froehlich, J. (2019) 
"*Exploring Sound Awareness in the Home for People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing*". Proceedings of 
CHI 2019. [Acceptance Rate: 23.7% (701 / 2960)]
