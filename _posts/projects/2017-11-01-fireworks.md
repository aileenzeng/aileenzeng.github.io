Fireworks is a class project I did for CSC171 (Introduction to Computer Science) at the University
of Rochester. It features a customizable fireworks display application using Java Swing. It contains
a user interface on the bottom that allows the user to change the trajectory of the fireworks, the
patterns of each firework, and the number of fireworks to show.
