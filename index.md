Hello! My name is Aileen Zeng. I am a Junior at the University of Washington studying Computer 
Science. This summer, I'm interning Google with the Play Books team. I also am doing accessibility 
research at the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) for 
[Project Sidewalk](https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/). I also used to TA for the Introduction
to Computer Science course at University of Rochester.

In my spare time, I also like playing violin, running and playing board games!
