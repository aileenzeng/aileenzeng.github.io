Hello! My name is Aileen Zeng. I am a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Computer Science. I am currently working in the [`Makeability Lab`](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) on [`Project Sidewalk`](https://sidewalk.umiacs.umd.edu/). You can read more about what I've been up to on my [`Projects`](https://aileenzeng.github.io/projects) page.

I previously was at the University of Rochester, where I was a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Computer Science class (in Java).

In my spare time, I like to run, prctice violin, hike, and play card games.
